# Multiview Datasets

This repository contains the code for handling several multiview datasets. 
In particular, it contains the following datasets:

- [ ] [MP3D-VO Dataset](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/robust_360_8PA): A dataset of sequence of 360-images for visual odometry task.
- [ ] [MP3D-FPE Dataset](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/direct_360_FPE): A dataset for floor plan estimation using multiple 360-images.
- [x] [MP3D-FPE-MLV Dataset](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/360-mlc): A dataset for multiview layout estimation. Particularly, for self-training 360-layout models.
- [x] [360-HM3D-MLV Dataset](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/360-mlc): A dataset for multiview layout estimation using HM3D dataset.

cd multiview-datasets
pip install -e .
```

## Download MLV-Datasets
The mvl-datasets is host in [huggingface/EnriqueSolarte/mvl_datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EnriqueSolarte/mvl_datasets) ðŸ¤—. 

> [!WARNING]  
> To access to the mvl-datasets (i.e., hm3d-mvl, mp3d-mvl, and zind-mvl), you need to create an account and login on HuggingFace and accept the terms and conditions described [HERE](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EnriqueSolarte/mvl_datasets). 

After you get access to the datasets, you have to login your account in your system by following the next commands:

```bash
# Install huggingface CLI 
pip install -U "huggingface_hub[cli]"

# Login to your account
huggingface-cli login

# Login to your account
huggingface-cli whoami
```

Ideally, after login you can download the mvl-dataset by executing the next commands: 
```bash

# To download and save the dataset in DIR_DATASET
python examples/download_mvl_data/mvl_datasets.py dir_mvl_dataset=${DIR_DATASET}

# To download mp3d_fpe_mvl, hm3d_mvl, or zind_mvl 
python examples/download_mvl_data/mvl_datasets.py dir_mvl_dataset=${DIR_DATASET} dataset=${DATASET_NAME}

# To use the default OmegaConfig in the examples/download_mvl_data/cfg.yaml 
python examples/download_mvl_data/mvl_datasets.py
```

> [!NOTE]
> These datasets were officially proposed in [360-MLC - NeuriPS'22](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/360-mlc) and [Ray-casting MLC - ECCV'24](https://github.com/EnriqueSolarte/ray_casting_mlc?tab=readme-ov-file). If you use them, please cite them accordingly.
